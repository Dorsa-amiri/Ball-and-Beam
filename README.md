# Ball and Beam

This repository contains our full implementation of a Ball and Beam control system using a 12 V DC motor and a custom-built PVC structure.  
Our main goal is to design, build, and control a real-time system that keeps a ping-pong ball balanced on a beam via sensors and actuators.  

Stay tuned for successive updates on control algorithms, electronics, and computer vision!

## üß± Mechanical Structure Overview

### PVC Beam
- Stacked 0.7 cm PVC sheets ‚Üí final beam length = 52 cm (with shaft clearance).

### Custom Gearbox
- 57-tooth spur gear meshed with a worm shaft mounted on the motor.  
- Height of motor adjusted using permanent cardboard layer (not a temporary shim).

### Shaft & Support
- Gear shaft held by two 3√ó7 perforated metal plates; PVC beam mounted directly.  
- Two edge stoppers placed along the beam (not at ends) to restrict ball motion to one axis.

### Beam Articulation
- Two 11-hole straight metal brackets (often called ‚Äúmetal strips‚Äù) connect gear to the beam.  
- Spring washers prevent nut loosening and ensure smooth ¬±15¬∞ beam rotation.

## üß™ Test Model & Lessons Learned

**Issues in the test version:**

- **PVC damage**: screws pierced PVC at some mount points  
  ‚Üí *Final fix*: replaced some joints with strong adhesive instead of mechanical fastening.

- **Unstable base**: initial base lacked rigidity  
  ‚Üí *Final fix*: used a rectangular solid block for high stability.

- **Limited rotation**: hinge joint limited beam motion  
  ‚Üí *Final fix*: replaced hinge with free-spinning shaft.

- **Gear misalignment**: motor height mismatched with gear  
  ‚Üí *Final fix*: fixed with a permanent cardboard layer under motor.

## ‚úÖ Final Model

### Precision Alignment
- Used level function of smartphone app (not compass) to align beam and motor shaft accurately.

### Rigid Support
- Added a sturdy rectangular base + in-line stoppers on beam to confine ball motion.

### Optimized Beam Articulation
- Replaced belts with straight 11-hole brackets to articulate beam with ¬±15¬∞ range.  
- Spring washers ensure joints stay tight without locking or jamming.

### Custom Gearbox
- Assembled using a 57T spur gear and worm shaft for high torque, low speed.  
- Entire gearbox was hand-assembled from separate components.

### Motor Mounting & Vibration Control
- Fixed motor using a semi-circular clamp + cardboard layer for height alignment.  
- Used super glue on gear to prevent internal nut from slipping during operation.

### Ultrasonic Sensor Mounting
- Ultrasonic sensor was mounted securely with tape and adjusted for optimal height, with additional consideration for echo reliability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Mechanical Challenges & Remedies

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Loosening or over-tightening of nuts at the connection of two 11-hole brackets     | Use spring washers under the nuts to maintain proper tension and prevent both loosening and jamming        |
| Motor vibration and gear misalignment                                              | Secure the motor with a semi-circular clamp and a permanent cardboard layer for precise height adjustment  |
| PVC cracking under screw mounting points                                           | Remove problematic screws and replace those joints with high-strength adhesive                             |
| Minor gap between beam and base causing wire-stopper rods to work loose over time  | Install a single integrated shaft with holders at both ends to eliminate the gap and secure the wire rods  |
| Sensor blind spots along the beam (ultrasonic couldn‚Äôt detect ball)                | Added a transparent tube (made of clear plastic sheet) around the beam to contain the ball and ensure consistent echo detection |

## üîß Assembly Instructions (Detailed)

1. **Cutting PVC Sheets and Drilling Shaft Hole**  
   We cut the PVC sheets to 52 cm in length (matching the beam‚Äôs width). A hole was drilled for the shaft, 2 cm from one end of the beam.

2. **Gearbox Installation**  
   The 57-tooth spur gear and worm shaft were mounted onto the motor shaft and secured tightly using a set screw.

3. **Beam Alignment and Height Adjustment**  
   Using the leveling tool in a smartphone app, we aligned the beam by adjusting the motor‚Äôs position along the beam axis and modifying the beam height. Then we installed the second shaft holder for permanent alignment.

4. **Motor and Bracket Mounting**  
   The motor was mounted on the base bracket, and a cardboard shim was placed underneath to raise its height. This ensured proper meshing between the worm shaft and the spur gear. The gear shaft was fixed onto a perforated metal plate using bolts.

5. **Attaching the 11-Hole Brackets**  
   Two straight 11-hole brackets were attached between the beam and gearbox. Nuts were tightened using spring washers, and ¬±15¬∞ beam rotation was tested.

6. **Sensor Placement**  
   The HC-SR05 ultrasonic sensor and MPU6050 IMU were installed near the beam‚Äôs centerline. The ultrasonic was mounted with electrical tape, not flush against the beam.

7. **Electronics Wiring**  
   Cables were connected to the Arduino Uno, and the motor was powered separately using a 7.4 V Li-ion battery.

## üîå Electrical & Sensor Integration

We initially used a **10-turn 10 kŒ© precision potentiometer**, but it proved impractical.  
The motor shaft did **not rotate the potentiometer even for a full turn**, which meant only a **small fraction of the potentiometer‚Äôs range** was being used. As a result, the signal became extremely sensitive to noise, and fine reading was unreliable.  
Since a **1-turn, 1 kŒ© precision potentiometer** (ideal for this setup) was unavailable, we switched to using the **MPU6050 IMU**.

This time, instead of relying on the **gyroscope**, which only measures angular velocity, we extracted the **beam‚Äôs angle using the accelerometer data**, which gave more stable absolute readings.  
As mentioned, we initially mounted the IMU to measure rotation about the Z-axis, but since gravity direction doesn‚Äôt change relative to that axis, no angle change was detected. We therefore re-mounted it to measure rotation about the Y-axis.

### Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR05)
- After identifying the optimal mounting height, we fixed the **ultrasonic sensor inside its plastic frame** and attached it to the beam using **electrical tape**.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Be cautious when connecting the pins** ‚Äì incorrect wiring can damage the sensor.  
- **Leave a slight gap** between the sensor and beam to avoid mechanical stress.  
- **Very small balls** may not reflect ultrasonic waves well enough for accurate detection.

#### Sensor Inaccuracy Issue
In certain positions along the beam, the sensor **failed to detect the ball** due to poor echo reception.  
üîß **Fix**: We created a **transparent tubular enclosure** over the beam using **clear plastic sheet (acrylic)**. The ball now rolls inside this tube, reducing detection errors while keeping friction low and preserving visibility.

## üíª Software & Control

*Coming soon* ‚Äì planned:  
- Project structure under `src/`  
- Simulation scripts (`simulate.py`)  
- PID tuning procedure (Ziegler‚ÄìNichols + manual adjust)  
- Data logging and visualization  
- A dedicated **test mode** to verify motor functionality before full system integration  
- Final and test Arduino codes to be uploaded soon

## üé• Image Processing (Optional)

We wrote a **Python script** using `cv2.VideoCapture` for basic image processing based on color filtering:

1. **Color Calibration**  
   - Placed three colored markers (red, green, blue) on the beam.  
   - The green and blue markers are fixed 50 cm apart (start and end of beam) to map pixels to centimeters.  

2. **Filter-Based Tracking**  
   - Used simple HSV color thresholds in OpenCV (`cv2.VideoCapture`) to isolate the ping-pong ball.  
   - Ensured real-time performance by limiting processing to a cropped region around the beam.

3. **Camera Stabilization**  
   - **Challenge**: Using a laptop webcam introduced occlusion at the beam edges.  
   - **Solution**: Employed the **DroidCam** app to turn a smartphone into a camera. We then streamed its video feed into Python, ensuring a full, unobstructed view and live distance readouts.
