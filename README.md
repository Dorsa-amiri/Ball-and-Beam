# Ball and Beam

This is an implementation of the Ball and Beam system using a DC motor and a custom-built PVC structure.

The main goal of this project is to design and build a real-time control system that keeps a ball balanced on a beam. 
We are currently focusing on the mechanical construction and sensor integration. Later, we will implement and test different controllers (such as PID).

üõ†Ô∏è **Key Highlights**:
- Built with lightweight 0.7 cm PVC sheets
- Uses a 600rpm, 12V DC motor with a worm gear for beam rotation
- Ping pong ball marked in red for potential image processing
- Sensor setup includes ultrasonic and angle measurement
- Full documentation and control logic will be added soon

Stay tuned for updates!
